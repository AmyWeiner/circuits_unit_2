        <h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
        <p>
            One website that I find particularly inspiraitonal with regards to layout and design is the <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/">Van Gogh Museum</a> website. Another website I find to be inspiraitonal is the personal site of the web designer and developer <a href="http://andrevv.com/">Andrew McCarthy</a>.   
        </p>

        <h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/">Van Gogh Museum</a> website makes a creative use of space, and incorporates an interesting navigation technique. Additionally, the look is clean and elegant, and the site is intuitive to use. Moreover, by employing animations and visual effects the site not only has an interactive feel, but also a great deal of content is able to be displayed in a manner that is neither busy nor overwhelming. <br><br>
            The personal site of the web designer and developer <a href="http://andrevv.com/">Andrew McCarthy</a> has a clean and elegant look, and is intuitive to use well. While the layout is simple, the use of the beautiful color palette prevents the page from appearing boring. In addition, the website employs a clever way of simulating animation by incorporating a series of static images into the scrolling of the page. 
        </p>

        <h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
        <p>
            These two websites are similar in that they both make use of a similar navigation and flow--scrolling through pages, as opposed to clicking through pages on the site. These two sites are also similar in that they incorporate stunning uses of color, animation, and other visual effects. Additionally, they are both clean, and elegant in their layout and design. <br><br>

            These two sites are different in their use of space and balance in that the <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/">Van Gogh Museum</a> website utilizes a side menu bar, which divides the page vertically, while the personal site of the web designer and developer <a href="http://andrevv.com/">Andrew McCarthy</a> is divided exclusively horizontally, by the bold sections of color.
